## ✨ Core Features

GemmaThrive brings together AI-powered productivity and reflection tools into one seamless offline experience.

---

### ✅ OrganizeMe

A smart workspace to help you **capture, manage, and act** on your thoughts and to-dos.

#### 🗂️ Tasks Tab — Where Sticky Notes Think for Themselves
The **Tasks Tab** is your intelligent, interactive Kanban board — redesigned for minds that need more than checkboxes.

Unlike traditional boards, this one feels **alive**:

- 🧠 **Sticky notes that talk back**: Each task is AI-enabled — tap a card and let **Gemma** suggest the best way to start, break it down into smaller steps, or even reframe your procrastination into action.
- 🎨 **Color-coded by priority**: Tasks are automatically styled based on urgency and importance — helping you focus without overthinking.
- ✋ **Drag & drop across columns**: Seamlessly move your notes between **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review**, and **Done**. Each column adapts with smooth animations and modern UI polish.
- 🌀 **Visual delight meets productivity**: Tilted sticky notes, hover animations, and pin-style effects turn organization into a calming ritual — not a chore.
- 🧠 **Gemma’s Role**: Gemma doesn’t just suggest — she executes. Tap “Let Gemma Help” and she’ll turn your vague goal into an actionable task list tailored to your energy, time, and focus level.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
