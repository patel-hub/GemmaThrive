## ✨ Core Features

GemmaThrive brings together AI-powered productivity and reflection tools into one seamless offline experience.

---

### ✅ OrganizeMe

A smart workspace to help you **capture, manage, and act** on your thoughts and to-dos.

#### 🗂️ Tasks Tab — Where Sticky Notes Think for Themselves
The **Tasks Tab** is your intelligent, interactive Kanban board, redesigned for minds that need more than checkboxes.

Unlike traditional boards, this one feels **alive**:

- 🧠 **Sticky notes that talk back**: Each task is AI-enabled, tap a card and let **Gemma** suggest the best way to start, break it down into smaller steps, or even reframe your procrastination into action.
  
- 🎨 **Color-coded by priority**: Tasks are automatically styled based on urgency and importance — helping you focus without overthinking.
  
- ✋ **Drag & drop across columns**: Seamlessly move your notes between **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review**, and **Done**. Each column adapts with smooth animations and modern UI polish.
  
- 🌀 **Visual delight meets productivity**: Tilted sticky notes, hover animations, and pin-style effects turn organization into a calming ritual and not a chore.

> 🔄 **Gemma’s Role**:  
Gemma doesn’t just suggest, she executes. Tap “Let Gemma Help” and she’ll turn your vague goal into an actionable task list tailored to your energy, time, and focus level.
  
> 💡 **The Problem It Solves**: 
Overwhelmed minds often avoid starting. This tab **removes friction** by making task management visual, responsive, and conversational. It’s not just a board, it’s a thinking space that works with you.

#### 🧩 Projects Tab - — Where Goals Get Their Own Space
The **Projects Tab** is designed for people juggling multiple initiatives like work, personal goals, creative ideas, or long-term plans.

Unlike the main **Tasks Tab**, which manages day-to-day stickies on a unified board, Projects Tab lets you **create fully separate boards for each project**, so you can focus deeply without mental clutter.

- ➕ **Manually create projects** and add subtasks at your own pace or tap into **Gemma’s planning magic**
  
- 🧠 **Let Gemma Plan It**: She’ll instantly generate a structured subtask list based on your project title and description
  
- 📅 **Auto-assigns due dates**: Gemma gives each subtask a reasonable deadline so your goals stay time-bound and not just “someday”
  
- 🗂️ **Dedicated Kanban board for every project**: Drag, edit, and delete subtasks across columns just like in the main board — but scoped to that project alone
  
- ✍️ **Interactive sticky notes**: Tap any subtask to edit it or click **“Break This Down with Gemma”** for even more granular starter steps
  
- 🧩 **Track autonomy**: Treat each project as its own micro-environment with full control and fewer distractions

> 🔄 **Gemma’s Role**:  
She’s your strategic co-pilot. Not only does she generate subtasks based on your project’s scope, she assigns due dates, estimates effort, and lets you further break down tasks with context. You’re never stuck staring at a blank board again.

> 💡 **The Problem It Solves**:  
Big goals often die in general to-do lists. The Projects Tab gives each vision a **home**, and **Gemma turns intentions into timelines**. It’s clarity without chaos, helping you follow through, one board at a time.

#### 📅 Planner Tab — Your Day, Designed by Gemma

The **Planner Tab** turns your tasks into a visual timeline — so instead of juggling sticky notes and mental to-do lists, you see a clear structure for your day.

- 📆 **Calendar View**: All your tasks (from Tasks Tab and Projects Tab) appear neatly on a calendar, so you can plan visually and intuitively.
  
- ✨ **“Let Gemma Plan My Day”** button: Tap once, and Gemma will:
  - Pick the most relevant tasks for today
  - Prioritize based on urgency and due dates

- ✅ **Checklist + Timeline**: Alongside your calendar, you’ll get a step-by-step breakdown of your day’s flow so you always know what to do next
  
- 🌱 **Includes balance**: Gemma’s plan isn’t just about productivity, it includes wellness suggestions. 

> 🔄 **Gemma’s Role**:  
Gemma becomes your **daily planner**, **wellness coach**, and **task prioritizer**, all in one. She reduces decision fatigue, adapts to your workload, and reminds you to be human, not just productive.

> 💡 **The Problem It Solves**:  
Most planners expect *you* to figure it out. This tab removes the guesswork by letting **Gemma structure your day** in a way that’s achievable, healthy, and motivating so you can stop stressing and start doing.

#### 🧠 MindMap Tab — Turn Thoughts Into Clear, Visual Structure

The **MindMap Tab** helps you map out ideas, goals, or problems into a clean, tree-style visualization that makes sense at a glance.

Whether you're brainstorming a passion project, planning a networking strategy, or untangling a messy thought, this tool helps you organize the mess in your mind.

- 💡 **Enter any idea or prompt** and instantly see it bloom into a visual mind map
- 
- 🌳 **Gemma organizes your thoughts** into:
  - Sections like subtopics, questions, ideas, or action plans
  - Clear top-down or radial layouts (your choice!)
    
- ✍️ **Every node includes context** — not just a word, but a helpful explanation so you understand each part
  
- 🔁 **Offline + AI-powered**: The structure is generated locally using your input and enhanced with Gemma’s semantic understanding

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
