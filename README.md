GemmaThrive brings together AI-powered productivity and reflection tools into one seamless offline experience.

---

### ✅ OrganizeMe

A smart workspace to help you **capture, manage, and act** on your thoughts and to-dos.

#### 🗂️ Tasks Tab — Where Sticky Notes Think for Themselves
The **Tasks Tab** is your intelligent, interactive Kanban board — redesigned for minds that need more than checkboxes.

Unlike traditional boards, this one feels **alive**:

- 🧠 **Sticky notes that talk back**: Each task is AI-enabled — tap a card and let **Gemma** suggest the best way to start, break it down into smaller steps, or even reframe your procrastination into action.
- 🎨 **Color-coded by priority**: Tasks are automatically styled based on urgency and importance — helping you focus without overthinking.
- ✋ **Drag & drop across columns**: Seamlessly move your notes between **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Review**, and **Done**. Each column adapts with smooth animations and modern UI polish.
- 🌀 **Visual delight meets productivity**: Tilted sticky notes, hover animations, and pin-style effects turn organization into a calming ritual — not a chore.
- 🧠 **Gemma’s Role**: Gemma doesn’t just suggest — she executes. Tap “Let Gemma Help” and she’ll turn your vague goal into an actionable task list tailored to your energy, time, and focus level.
- 💡 **The Problem It Solves**:  
Overwhelmed minds often avoid starting. This tab **removes friction** by making task management visual, responsive, and conversational. It’s not just a board — it’s a thinking space that works with you.

#### 🧩 Projects Tab - — Where Goals Get Their Own Space
The **Projects Tab** is designed for people juggling multiple initiatives — like work, personal goals, creative ideas, or long-term plans.

Unlike the main **Tasks Tab**, which manages day-to-day stickies on a unified board, Projects Tab lets you **create fully separate boards for each project**, so you can focus deeply without mental clutter.

- ➕ **Manually create projects** and add subtasks at your own pace — or tap into **Gemma’s planning magic**
- 🧠 **Let Gemma Plan It**: She’ll instantly generate a structured subtask list based on your project title and description
- 📅 **Auto-assigns due dates**: Gemma gives each subtask a reasonable deadline so your goals stay time-bound and not just “someday”
- 🗂️ **Dedicated Kanban board for every project**: Drag, edit, and delete subtasks across columns just like in the main board — but scoped to that project alone
- ✍️ **Interactive sticky notes**: Tap any subtask to edit it or click **“Break This Down with Gemma”** for even more granular starter steps
- 🧩 **Track autonomy**: Treat each project as its own micro-environment with full control and fewer distractions

> 🔄 **Gemma’s Role**:  
She’s your strategic co-pilot. Not only does she generate subtasks based on your project’s scope — she assigns due dates, estimates effort, and lets you further break down tasks with context. You’re never stuck staring at a blank board again.
> 💡 **The Problem It Solves**:  
Big goals often die in general to-do lists. The Projects Tab gives each vision a **home**, and **Gemma turns intentions into timelines**. It’s clarity without chaos — helping you follow through, one board at a time.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
